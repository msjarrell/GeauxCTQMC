\section{$G(\tau)$}
See akiss notes 2.4.

\[
G(\tau)=-\left\langle\frac{1}{\beta}\sum_{ij}^k
\left(\Delta^{(k)}\right)^{-1}_{ji}\delta(\tau,\tau_i'-\tau_j)\right\rangle_{MC}
=-\left\langle\frac{1}{\beta}\sum_{ij}^k
M^{(k)}_{ji}\delta(\tau,\tau_i'-\tau_j)\right\rangle_{MC}
\]
To reduce noise and save memory, split $\beta$ in to fine grids \verb|N_TAU| and bin data. 
Note that for small number of \verb|N_TAU|,
the Fourier transform back to Matsubara frequency may be inaccurate. 

\section{$G(i\omega)$}
Fourier transform each contribution to Green's function:
\[
G(i\omega)=-\langle\frac{1}{\beta}\sum_{i,j}\exp^{i\omega(\tau_j'-\tau_j)}M_{ji}\rangle_{MC}
\]

When compiling, define \verb|-DMEASURE_GIO| to enable this measurement.

Noisy at high frequencies. 
\section{Using Legendre Polynomials}
To reduce high frequency noise, one can use a set of Legendre polynomials as basis and measure the coefficients. See arxiv:1104.32115.
\[
G_l=\sqrt{2l+1}\int_0^\beta d\tau P_l(x(\tau))G(\tau)
\]

In CTHYB:
\[
G_l=-\frac{\sqrt{2l+1}}{\beta}\left\langle\sum_{ij}M_{ji}\tilde{P}_l(\tau_i'-\tau_j)\right\rangle_{MC}
\]
Where
\[
\tilde{P}(\tau)=\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
  P_l(x(\tau))& \tau >0\\
  -P_l(x(\tau+\beta))&\tau<0
\end{array}
\right.
\]
and \[
x(\tau)=2\tau/\beta-1
\]

To restore $G(\tau)$ or $G(i\omega)$ from the measured set of coefficients,
\[
G(\tau) = \sum_{l\ge 0}\frac{\sqrt{2l+1}}{\beta}P_l(x(\tau))G_l
\]
and
\[
G(i\omega) = \sum_{l\ge 0} G_l\frac{\sqrt{2l+1}}{\beta}\int_0^\beta\exp^{i\omega_n\tau}P_l(x(\tau))=\sum_{l\ge 0}T_{nl}G_l
\]
Where
\[
T_{nl}=(-1)^ni^{l+1}\sqrt{2l+1}j_l\left(\frac{(2n+1)\pi}{2}\right)
\]
and $j_l(z)$ are spherical Bessel functions. Note that in the procedure, no model-guided Fourier transform is used.

By setting an appropriate cut-off at number of Legendre series, high frequency noise is filtered. TRIQS used 80. 

When compiling the code, use \verb|-DMEASURE_LEG| to enable this measurement.
